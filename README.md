  ## Description

  This is a handy Progressive Web Application  for tracking expenses while travelling. The application can be installed on a mobile device and run with or without an internet connection. When running in offline mode, the app will store your transactions in a local database temporarily. When an internet connection becomes available again, the application will sync your transactions with an online database where they can be accessed from any device.
